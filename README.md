# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the machine learning projects repository! Here, you'll find various projects focused on data analysis and classification tasks. Each project is designed to learn and practice different aspects of machine learning.

## Project 1: Data Visualization and Classification

**Objective:** Explore a dataset, establish a classification problem, and train models.

**Key Tasks:**
- Load dataset and conduct statistical analysis.
- Establish classification problem.
- Train models and evaluate performance using cross-validation.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters and test best model's performance.

## Project 2: Wine Quality Classification (Part 1)

**Objective:** Predict wine quality based on various features.

**Key Tasks:**
- Conduct statistical analysis and preprocess data.
- Experiment with Decision Tree and SVM models.
- Study impact of feature selection techniques.
- Evaluate model performance and discuss findings.

## Project 3: Wine Quality Classification (Part 2)

**Objective:** Improve wine quality prediction using MLPClassifier.

**Key Tasks:**
- Explore different MLPClassifier architectures and optimizer parameters.
- Test performance with various scoring methods.
- Compare MLPClassifier results with different classifier.

Each project comes with detailed Jupyter Notebooks containing explanations, code implementations, and analysis.
